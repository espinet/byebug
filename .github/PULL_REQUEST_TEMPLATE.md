## Description

Replace this text with a summary of the changes in your PR. Use gramatically
correct, complete sentences. The more detailed you are, the better. If your PR
is fixing a specific issue, use [Github's syntax][autoclose] to autoclose the PR on
merge. Don't use this syntax in specific commit messages, just in the PR's
description.

## Requirements

Before submitting the PR make sure the following are checked:

* [ ] Wrote [good commit messages][commits].
* [ ] Used the same coding conventions as the rest of the project.
* [ ] Feature branch is up-to-date with `master` (if not - rebase it).
* [ ] Squashed related commits together.
* [ ] All tests are passing.
* [ ] The PR relates to *only* one subject.

You might also be asked to:

* [ ] Add tests.
* [ ] Add a Changelog entry if the new code introduces user-observable changes.
